## Strategy
### Lambda-man
Implementing Scheme-like language (Rabbit) to write Lambda-man AI.
Final submission is [rabbit/uct.rabbit](https://github.com/osak/ICFPC2014/blob/master/rabbit/uct.rabbit)
(Despite of its name, it doesn't use UCT algorithm.)

The AI performs breadth-first search to find pills then scores them by distance.
It also consider nearby ghosts which affect with decreasing score on surrounding cells.
Then AI goes along to a highest-scored cell.

### Ghost
Implementing macro preprocessor (Mofu) to write Ghost AIs.
Final submission are [mofu/tourist.mofu](https://github.com/osak/ICFPC2014/blob/master/mofu/tourist.mofu)
and [mofu/traveler.mofu](https://github.com/osak/ICFPC2014/blob/master/mofu/traveler.mofu) .
